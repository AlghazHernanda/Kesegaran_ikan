            <div class="isi">
                <p>In general, fish and fishery products are perishable foods because they contain high enough protein
                    and water, therefore proper care of fish is very important. Such treatment can be done by reducing
                    the temperature such as cooling and freezing to prevent a decrease in the quality of the fish.</p>
                <p>The freshness of fish is very important in determining the overall quality of a fishery product.
                    Quality freshness may include the appearance, taste, smell and texture that will be consciously or
                    unconsciously assessed by the buyer or user of the product.
                    Here are some characteristics of fresh fish that can be seen, such as:</p>

                        <h5>1. Fish Eyes</h5>
                        <p>Fresh fish eyes look bright with a black color in the middle. The surface also feels
                            prominent and supple to the touch. Conversely, if the eyes of fish that are not fresh turned
                            out to be sunken and visible into the eye sockets
                            and the part of the eye that should be yellowish white also changes color to reddish.

                    <h5>2. Fish Gills</h5>
                        <p>
                            Lift the gill cover on the side of the fish head. Freshly caught fish have red gills that
                            look clean and fresh. The redder the gill color, the better the quart. Tanned or gray gills
                            with gills appearing separately from each other, indicating that the quality of the fish has
                            decreased.

                    <h5>3. Skin and Scales</h5>
                        <p>
                            One easy way to choose fresh fish is to observe the color of the skin and scales. Good
                            quality fish skin looks shiny with a bright color. The scales are still firmly attached to
                            the body of the fish and do not easily detach when pulled. Meanwhile, low-quality fish have
                            dull skin and scales. When stored, the scales are also easy to loosen.
                        </p>

                    <h5>4. Stomach</h5>
                        <p>
                            Another way to choose fresh fish is to press on the stomach. The fresh belly of the fish
                            feels supple when pressed and can return to its original shape. Meanwhile, low-quality fish
                            has a soft stomach texture. The contents of the stomach can also easily decompose if you
                            press it.

                    <h5>5. Fish Meat</h5>
                        <p>
                            The meat of fresh fish looks clear with a bright transcendent color. Some types of fish have
                            a bright white flesh color, but there are also types of fish that have different colors. No
                            matter what type of fish you choose, make sure the color is bright and not dull.
                            Fresh fish has a soft texture, but it is sticky enough that it can return to its original
                            shape after pressing. The whole meat also sticks firmly to the legs. Unlike fresh fish, fish
                            meat whose quality decreases dull. The texture also changed to softer.
